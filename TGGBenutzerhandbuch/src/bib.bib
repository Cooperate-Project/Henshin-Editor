  abstract = {The tool Henshin is an Eclipse plug-in supporting visual modeling
    and execution of rule-based EMF model transformations. This paper
    describes the recent extensions of Henshin by a visual editor for
    triple graph grammars (TGGs). The visual editor (called HenshinTGG)
    supports a compact visualization of triple rules in an integrated
    editor panel. Internally, triple graph rules are represented as Henshin
    rules and can be simulated using the Henshin EMF model transformation
    engine. Our extension supports the automatic generation of forward
    translation rules for transforming source into target models. A converter
    from Henshin TGG rules to the graph transformation analysis tool
    AGG allows a systematic check for conflicts of forward translation
    rules in AGG based on critical pair analysis.},
