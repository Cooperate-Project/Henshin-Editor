{"name":"Henshin-editor","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the multi-view based Henshin Editors and Henshin TGG Engine.\r\nThe Henshin Multi-View Editor is an alternative to the integrated Henshin Graphical Editor. It is based on the Muvitor framework and maintained at [TU Berlin](http://www.tu-berlin.de/tfs) and [Uni Luxembourg](http://wwwde.uni.lu/snt).\r\n\r\n**Main differences**\r\n\r\n* Multi-view: the editor provides a tree-view of the transformation system and graphical views for rules and graphs\r\n* Visual simulation: you can create a graph and apply your rules in the GUI\r\n* Rule view with separate LHS and RHS instead of an integrated view \r\n\r\n### Henshin TGG Engine\r\nThe henshin tgg engine extends the henshin engine by features based on triple graph grammars (TGGs) used for:\r\n* bidirectional model transformation\r\n* model integration\r\n* incremental model synchronisation (state based and delta based)\r\n\r\n### Henshin TGG Editor\r\nThe henshinTGG editor provides an IDE for deveoping and simulating TGGs via a graphical multi-view editor user interface:\r\n* creation of TGG rules\r\n* creation of triple graphs\r\n* generation of operational rules (forward translation - FT, backward translation - BT, consistency creating - CC, integration - IT)\r\n* execution and simulation of TGG operations: forward model transformation (=FT=>), backward model transformation (=BT=>), model integration (=IT=), consistency checking (=CC=), state based forward and backward propagation (=S-fPpg=>, <=S-bPpg=), delta based forward and backward propagation (=D-fPpg=>, <=D-bPpg=)\r\n\r\n### Availability\r\n\r\nMulti-View Editor is is available here at github. The repository contains the Henshin base plugins as well, which are extended to fit to the HenshinTGG editor.\r\n\r\nTo try the Muvitor-based Henshin-Editor, it is suggested that you use the plug-ins from the github repository. \r\nYou can clone the repository and start the editor by\r\n     1. Import the plug-ins from the github repository into your main workspace\r\n     2. Run > Run as > Eclipse application \r\n\r\n### Further Information\r\n[Webpage at TU Berlin](http://www.user.tu-berlin.de/lieske/tfs/projekte/henshin/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
